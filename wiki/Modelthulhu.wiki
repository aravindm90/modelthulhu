#summary Modelthulhu Real-time CSG Library

= Introduction =

*Modelthulhu* is a class library for real-time Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG), but really just mesh Boolean ops. It is written in the C# programming language.

= Development Progress =

== Current Status ==

Modelthulhu has been extracted from the project into which it was originally integrated. The extracted project does not build, but fixing this should be trivial.

== Prior to Extraction ==

The CSG code was working properly prior to extraction, but did not yet work in real-time. Getting that to happen will require some non-trivial work, with significant refactoring and redesign of some aspects.
